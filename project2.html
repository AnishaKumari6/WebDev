    <p>Eating healthy involves making balanced food choices that nourish your body, support overall health, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
    Key Components of a Healthy Diet
    1.Variety of Foods: A healthy diet includes a wide range of foods from all food groups. This ensures you get a balanced intake of essential nutrients. Aim to fill half your plate with vegetables and fruits, a quarter with whole grains, and a quarter with protein foods. 
    
    2.Focus on Whole Foods: Choose whole, minimally processed foods over highly processed options. Whole grains, fresh fruits, and vegetables are packed with nutrients and fiber, which help maintain a healthy weight and improve digestion. </p>
